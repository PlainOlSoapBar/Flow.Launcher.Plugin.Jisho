# Jisho Plugin

A plugin built for [Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/), that allows you to quickly lookup words hosted on the online Japanese-English dictionary, [Jisho](https://jisho.org/).

Start your lookup with <kbd>ji</kbd> *(configurable in the plugin settings)*, then search your word! You can use English, Japanese, or Romaji.

Select a result to open the respective webpage on your browser.
